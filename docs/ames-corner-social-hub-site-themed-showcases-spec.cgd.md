# Ame's Corner Site-Themed Showcases Spec (CGD)

Source: `docs/ames-corner-social-hub-site-themed-showcases-spec.md`

## Clarity Review Summary
1. Scope explicitly targets Steam-profile fidelity and per-site visual differentiation.
2. Showcase expansion rule is concrete (`overview` + `activity` + optional `media` per platform).
3. Runtime constraints preserve existing data orchestration and loader continuity.
4. Validation plan covers density, site variant classes, responsiveness, and regression.

## Verification Notes (9 Points)
1. Hypothesis vs Fact Labeling: Pass. Requirements are implementation-prescriptive.
2. Uncertainty Marker Enforcement: Pass. No unresolved speculative language.
3. Assumption Visibility: Pass. Layout and fallback assumptions are explicit.
4. Authoritative-looking Unvalidated Data: Pass. No unverifiable external metrics asserted.
5. Data Consistency: Pass. Showcase, styling, and runtime contracts align.
6. Implicit Causation: Pass. No unsupported causal claims.
7. Future State as Present: Pass. Document specifies immediate implementation intent.
8. Temporal Coherence: Pass. Processed date is current.
9. Externally Verifiable Claims: Pass. No pending external verification claims.

## HITL Verification Record

### Round A: Derived Data Confirmation
1. No external numeric claims require source verification.

### Round B: True HITL Verification
1. No pending HITL claims.
