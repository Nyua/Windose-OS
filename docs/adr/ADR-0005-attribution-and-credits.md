# ADR-0005: Attribution and Credits
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Accepted

## Context
User confirmed permission to create a fansite, with the condition that ownership of rights and original art assets is clearly credited. Fonts are open source and redistributable, and must be credited as well.

## Decision
Add a Credits page inside the Settings menu. The page will list rights holders, original art asset ownership, and font credits.

## Consequences
- Requires a Settings/Control Panel entry point and a Credits view in Phase 1.
- Credits text must be explicit and visible to users.
- Attribution copy should be reviewed for accuracy before launch.
