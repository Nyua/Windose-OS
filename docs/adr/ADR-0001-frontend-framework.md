# ADR-0001: Frontend Framework
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: Accepted

## Context
The implementation roadmap allows either React or Vue. Choosing one is required to avoid ambiguous architecture and tooling decisions.

## Decision
Use Vue 3 with Vite. Single-File Components (SFCs) are the default component format.

## Consequences
- Determines component patterns, routing, state integration, and build tooling.
- Impacts developer ergonomics and available UI libraries.

## Open Questions
- None.
