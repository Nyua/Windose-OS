# Ame's Corner Social Hub Rebuild Spec (CGD)

Source: `docs/ames-corner-social-hub-rebuild-spec.md`

## Clarity Review Summary
1. Scope is explicit and bounded: BIOS/loader preserved, post-loader shell replaced end-to-end.
2. Runtime contracts are decision-complete for layout, data strategy, embeds, and host allowlist expansion.
3. Error matrix and anti-pattern sections are implementation-facing and map directly to code behavior.
4. Test specifications include both functional validation and regression/build safeguards.

## Verification Notes (9 Points)
1. Hypothesis vs Fact Labeling: Pass. Document is prescriptive and implementation-scoped.
2. Uncertainty Marker Enforcement: Pass. No unresolved speculative claims remain.
3. Assumption Visibility: Pass. Fallback assumptions and mobile behavior limits are explicit.
4. Authoritative-looking Unvalidated Data: Pass. No unsupported external metrics asserted as fact.
5. Data Consistency: Pass. Scope, contracts, and tests align with the same six-site model.
6. Implicit Causation: Pass. Causal language is avoided; behavior is defined as contract.
7. Future State as Present: Pass. Statements are implementation requirements for this pass.
8. Temporal Coherence: Pass. Processed date matches current session date.
9. Externally Verifiable Claims: Pass. No external truth-claims require citation verification.

## HITL Verification Record

### Round A: Derived Data Confirmation
1. No external-source numeric claims require source reconciliation.

### Round B: True HITL Verification
1. No pending HITL claims; document is implementation-internal and review-complete.
