# Ames Corner Ferrofluid Timeline Editor Spec (CGD)

Source: `docs/ames-corner-ferrofluid-spin-timeline-spec.md`

## Clarity Review Summary
- Scope is explicit to Ame Corner runtime and stylesheet files.
- Runtime behavior is decision-complete for scrubbing, timeline editing, save semantics, and render integration.
- Default-save authority is bounded and deterministic.
- Segment schema and field constraints are explicit enough for implementation without inference.
- Test coverage is directly mapped to requested interaction behavior.

## Verification Notes (9 Points)
1. Hypothesis vs Fact Labeling: Pass.
2. Uncertainty Markers: Pass.
3. Assumption Visibility: Pass.
4. Authoritative-looking Unvalidated Data: Pass.
5. Data Consistency: Pass.
6. Implicit Causation: Pass.
7. Future State as Present: Pass.
8. Temporal Coherence: Pass.
9. Externally Verifiable Claims: Pass.

## HITL Verification Record
### Round A
- Internal implementation spec only; no external claim verification required.

### Round B
- No pending claims.
