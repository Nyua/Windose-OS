# Ame's Corner Social Hub Steam-Style Scroll Spec (CGD)

Source: `docs/ames-corner-social-hub-steam-scroll-spec.md`

## Clarity Review Summary
1. Scope is explicit: Steam-style scroll layout replaces fixed grid dashboard.
2. Constraints remain stable: BIOS/loader unchanged, social-only post-loader runtime.
3. Data and interaction contracts preserve existing live+fallback semantics.
4. Test matrix covers scroll behavior, responsive layout, embeds, and regressions.

## Verification Notes (9 Points)
1. Hypothesis vs Fact Labeling: Pass. Statements are implementation requirements.
2. Uncertainty Marker Enforcement: Pass. No speculative claims left unresolved.
3. Assumption Visibility: Pass. Scroll container and layout assumptions are explicit.
4. Authoritative-looking Unvalidated Data: Pass. No unverifiable external metrics claimed.
5. Data Consistency: Pass. Layout, runtime, and test contracts are aligned.
6. Implicit Causation: Pass. No unsupported causal language.
7. Future State as Present: Pass. Document specifies immediate implementation changes.
8. Temporal Coherence: Pass. Processed date matches session date.
9. Externally Verifiable Claims: Pass. No pending external verification claims.

## HITL Verification Record

### Round A: Derived Data Confirmation
1. No external numeric claims require source confirmation.

### Round B: True HITL Verification
1. No pending HITL claims.
